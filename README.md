MATLAB codes used to compute information measures and behavioral metrics in article: <link to paper, DOI>
MATLAB version: MATLAB2020b, MATLAB2024

The Figure indices corresponding to figures in the manuscript are included in the script name. 
Script Figure4_*.m plots for main Figure4, and also Supplementary Figures S8, S9 and S10. 
The source data for plotting the figures can be found here: https://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/deposit/xxxx

Computation of the information measures which are central to this project was done with the MINT:

Scripts which compute the information measures using MINT with source data (principal components, can be found here: https://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/deposit/xxxx):
  Intersection information: confbias_MINTII_int12_cic.m 
  Mutual information: confbias_MINTMI_int12_SE.m

Script which computes the intersection information linear proxy, corr(s^hat, E) in Figure S11:
